Small theme for AwesomeWM. Camel is being developed as a starting point
for Gnu/Linux :penguin: users who are transitioning from a complete Desktop Environment to a complete Window Manager, this theme does not
aim to be "simple" or "minimalistic", it aims to be complete, **heavily opinionated** and user* friendly.
